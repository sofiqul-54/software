The Time Boss PRO is the simple time manager program for all 
users registered in Windows.

The Time Boss PRO has: the event log (journal) for start-stop events 
of users, internet sites and programs; the screenshots log 
and statistics; the simple and clear interface with multilanguage 
support.

The principle of work of the program is simple:  for all users you 
can define the  time limit for work on PC.  As soon as the user 
exceeds the  limit, the program  automatically finishes his session. 

The program blocks the start of forbidden programs or internet 
sites specified for users (for example:  Skype or any games).

The program uses official  protective mechanisms  of Windows 
system and doesn't create espionage modules. Time Boss doesn't 
mask  in components  of the  operational  environment, doesn't 
litter  system  folders and  doesn't  reduce   speed of  other 
programs.

to try the new version, then fully uninstall the old version and install 
the new version. You can try the new version only 3 days!

After installation we strongly advise to change the password to 
Time Boss Control panel, so that your kids won't be able to 
open it and to reconfigure Time Boss from their sessions.
